## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes Cluster
- nginx Ingress Controller ([Docs](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/)) must be deployed in the K8s cluster
- Argo CD CLI installed ([Docs](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/#2-download-argo-cd-cli))

> [!CAUTION]
> The application uses K8s `Ingress` resources and won't work if no [Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/) is installed. 

> [!TIP]
> The nginx Ingress Controller is available as Helm-Chart which can be managed with Argo CD too.
> 
> Once Argo CD is installed in the Cluster, [this readme file](docs/90-Argo-CD-nginx-Ingress-Controller.runme.md) describe how to deploy the nginx Ingress Controller via Argo CD.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The nginx Ingress Controller provides a `IngressClass` which is named `nginx`.
> **Kubernetes `Ingress` Resources must therefore use the `ingressClassName: nginx`.**
>
> This configuration is done for all existing resources, but must be considered for new resources or changes.

## CI/CD Architecture

**Pull-based Continuous Deployment**:

- Everything is pulled and observed from inside the cluster
- Increased security because no external access to the cluster is required
    - With a push-based approach, the cluster must be reachable from the outside and the CI/CD system needs high-privilege credentials

![Pull-based CD](docs/assets/pull-based-cd.svg)

**Continuous Integration and Delivery with GitHub Actions**:

- Verify backend, frontend, and K8s definitions
- Build and package the backend and frontend into a container image and push it to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
- Run security checks 
- Update the K8s manifests with the image versions and push the changes back to the GitHub Repository
- Move the environment tags forward

![CI/CD with GitHub Actions](docs/assets/ci-overview-github-actions.svg)

**Continuous Deployment with Argo CD**:

- Argo CD observes the environment tag and maintains the desired state in the K8s cluster
- Each environment has its own namespace
- The images defined in the target-revision are pulled from GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)

![CD with Argo CD](docs/assets/cd-overview-argocd.svg)

**Multi-Environment support with Kustomize**:

- Prevent duplicated manifests
- Replace certain values
- Add a prefix to any resource
